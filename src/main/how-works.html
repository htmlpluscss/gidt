					The main purpose of ColdStack System is to store and retrieve userâ€™s data in a stack of Clouds via Unified Data Exchange API, which is 100% compatible with Amazon S3 API. That allows to use any AWS library or SDK and start to use our ColdStack without significant integration efforts.
				</p>

				<p>
					Initially the data file goes to the Upload Node (which can issue NFT tokens for the uploaded files) and then transmitted to one of Decentralized Cloud Storages. Users can specify the exact Storage or save up to 80% of the storage cost by allowing our AI-based engine to optimize the further process.
				</p>

				<p>
					All the costs are calculated at the Billing Node in $CLS: ColdStack ERC20 Tokens. Due to the ETH high  transaction price and latency, we use Polkadot infrastructure for transactional billing (per each data storage / retrieval operation). Decentralized Clouds such as Filecoin and SIA are charging for the data storage space in their own coins such as $FIL and $SC, so we use Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) to supply our users with a unified payment gateway.
